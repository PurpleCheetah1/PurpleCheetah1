## Hi there 👋

### My name is Chloe (PurpleCheetah1) and I am an aspiring programmer and IT nerd 😄

As a university student, I am hoping to learn as much about Computer Science as possible, and be well-versed in many programming languages 🖥️!

Some things I like:
* 🎥 making (and watching) movies
* 🎼 music
* 💻 working with technology
* 👥 making friends
* 🧗‍♀️ rock-climbing
